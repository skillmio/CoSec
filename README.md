# Protective DNS (PDNS)

**Protective DNS (PDNS)** is an open-source project that provides **secure DNS resolution** and **domain filtering**, focused on improving **privacy, security, and performance**.

As a result of its processing pipeline, PDNS **automatically generates a blocklist (adblock / denylist)** that can be directly used by **DNS servers and firewalls**.

---

## Key Features

* Blocks **ads**, **trackers**, **phishing**, **malware**, and **suspicious domains**
* Improves **user privacy** and **network security**
* Reduces **latency** and **bandwidth usage**
* Centralized protection for the entire network
* Suitable for **home, enterprise, and on-prem / cloud environments**

---

## Output

The main output of this project is a **ready-to-use blocklist**, compatible with:

* DNS servers
  *(Unbound, BIND, Pi-hole, AdGuard, Technitium, etc.)*
* Firewalls and NGFWs
  *(OPNsense, pfSense, FortiGate, Palo Alto, etc.)*
* Network filtering and security platforms
* SIEM and monitoring tools

The blocklist can be **automatically updated** and integrated into existing security workflows.

---

## Compatibility

PDNS can be deployed on almost any device or platform, including:

* Windows, Linux, macOS
* Android and iOS
* Routers, firewalls, and gateways
* On-premises and cloud infrastructures

It supports modern secure DNS protocols:

* **DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)**
* **DNS-over-TLS (DoT)**

## Public DNS Servers

```
dns1:

## Use Cases

* Network-wide ad and tracker blocking
* Phishing and malware domain protection
* Privacy-focused DNS resolution
* DNS filtering for corporate or home networks
